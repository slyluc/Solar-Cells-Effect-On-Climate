# Solar-Cells-Effect-On-Climate
This project investigates whether solar panels contribute to global warming using a simplified energy balance model. It employs numerical methods like the 4th-order Runge-Kutta and Monte Carlo simulations to analyze various greenhouse gas scenarios and the impact of solar panel albedo changes on Earth's ocean surface temperature.
